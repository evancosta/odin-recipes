Project: Recipes

I am going to build a basic recipe website to practice the HTML knowledge I have aquired. The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes. I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

Once I have completed the project, I will have demonstrated the skills necessary to set up an HTML directory, the HTML boilerplate, and a basic website with links.
